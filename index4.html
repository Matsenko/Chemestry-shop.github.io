<p>When Walter White and Jesse Pinkman decide to team up, Jesse informs Walt that he neglected to think of an appropriate location for them to cook, suggesting they purchase a "camper" so they can set-up a mobile lab, so Walt gives Jesse his life savings, an amount less than $7000, and tells him to buy an RV. In the following day, Jesse shows up with a 1986 Fleetwood Bounder, and they drive into the desert to start cooking. After the second cook session, the two are attacked by Krazy-8 and Emilio Koyama, with Walt being forced to cook his recipe to them. But Walt manages to trick them instead, poisoning them with phosphine gas and locking both inside the RV. A panicked Emilio tries to shoot his way out, but fails miserably, opening only five small bullet holes on the door that didn't manage to save his life. After the confusion, Walt tries to drive the RV away, carrying the bodies of both Krazy-8 and Emilio, but he ends up driving into a ditch. ("Pilot")</p>
